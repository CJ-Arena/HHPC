					<p>The year is divided into four three-month quarters. Each month begins on the same day and date each year. The first two months of each quarter are made up of 30 days, and the third is made up of 31 days. Each quarter contains the same number of days, which simplifies financial calculations; this methodology would have prevented Apple's Q4 2012 accounting fiasco, for example.<br> <br>
					Each quarter contains 91 days, resulting in a 364-day year that is comprised of 52 seven-day weeks. This is a vital feature of the HHPC because, by preserving the seven-day Sabbath cycle, the HHPC abides by the fourth commandment, thereby avoiding the major complaints from ecclesiastical quarters that have doomed all other attempts at calendar reform.<br> <br>
					</p>

					<p>
					Moreover, the HHPC accounts for the disparity between the length of our calendar (364 days) and that of the astronomical calendar (roughly 365.24 days, the duration of one full orbit of the Earth around the Sun) by simply tacking one additional full week to the end of every fifth or sixth year (specifically 2020, 2026, 2032, 2037, 2043, 2048, and so on). This keeps the calendar in line with the seasons, serving the same function as the leap year in the present Gregorian system. <br> <br>
					The multiplicity of calendars can be explained by a variety of scientific, cultural, economic, and religious factors. But, on a whole, it underscores the fact that no calendar has been able to fully address all of the issues associated with measuring and organizing the passing of time. The Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar represents the most acceptable permanent calendar reform to date.
